# TechnicalIndicatorsPredictiveAbility

Technical indicators exhibit some predictive ability when it comes to forecasting stock returns.

The persistence of the ability of 12 fundamental variables to predict the equity risk premium is analysed by the paper Momentum of return predictability (Wang(2018)). It shows that it is true for some of the models that if they outperformed the historical average forecast for the excess return are likely to do so in the current period as well.

This property is called the momentum of predictability, and I examined the presence or non-presence of it for technical indicators instead of fundamental variables. The pdf file in the repo, and the abovementioned article contains everything related to the methodology.
